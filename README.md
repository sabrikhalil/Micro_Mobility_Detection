This project introduces a novel object detection model, FGFA-YOLOX, specifically designed to enhance the detection of micromobility vehicles (MMVs) such as e-scooters, bikes, and skateboards in urban traffic videos. By integrating the accuracy and speed of single-frame detection with the enriched temporal features of video-based frameworks, FGFA-YOLOX significantly advances the state-of-the-art in urban mobility analytics.

## Key Contributions

- Introduction of the FGFA-YOLOX model, offering a significant leap in detecting micromobility vehicles within urban settings.
- Construction of a comprehensive dataset focused on urban micromobility, aiming to propel further research by making it publicly available.

## Model Architecture

Below is the architecture of our FGFA-YOLOX model, illustrating the innovative integration of spatio-temporal features for enhanced object detection in complex urban environments.
